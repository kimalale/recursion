# Project: Recursion

Understanding Recursion through Fibonacci & Merge Sort

## Project: Fibonacci
### Assignment 1
        Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

## Project: Merge Sort
        Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
